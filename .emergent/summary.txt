The trajectory details the development of a web application, a clone of , rebranded as you and localized to Brazilian Portuguese. The process began with a thorough analysis of the original application, including web crawling and screenshots, to understand its features and design.

The AI engineer initially built a comprehensive frontend using React, creating numerous components and pages with mock data to achieve feature parity. This was an iterative process, with the user prompting for deeper checks to ensure all functionalities, like dropdown navigation and a proper footer, were replicated.

A significant architectural shift occurred during backend development. Despite the initial environment being a FastAPI/Python setup, the engineer implemented a completely new backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This included creating data models, authentication (JWT), AI service integration, and a full suite of API routes.

The final phase involved integrating the React frontend with the new Node.js backend, replacing mock data with live API calls. However, this integration introduced critical bugs reported by the user, including an unexpected MetaMask error, a quiz progression failure, and an inability to create an account. The current focus is to diagnose and resolve these user-facing issues.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to create a pixel-perfect, feature-complete clone of the AI-powered personal growth application .

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Rebranding & Localization:** The application must be named you and all text content must be in Brazilian Portuguese.
2.  **Feature Parity:** The clone must replicate all functionalities of the original application. This includes:
    *   User authentication (Login/Registration).
    *   A multi-step personality quiz.
    *   A comprehensive user dashboard with analytics and insights.
    *   An AI-powered chat feature.
    *   Goal tracking, pricing, FAQ, and contact pages.
    *   Complex navigation with dropdown menus and a responsive mobile layout.
3.  **Technical Stack:**
    *   **Frontend:** React with Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Backend:** A full-stack implementation with a persistent database (MongoDB), secure user authentication (JWT), and real AI integration for the chat feature.
4.  **Current State & Immediate Need:** The frontend is visually complete, and a Node.js backend has been built and integrated. However, the application is currently unusable due to critical bugs reported during user testing. The immediate priority is to fix:
    *   An erroneous Failed to connect to MetaMask error on forms.
    *   A bug preventing quiz completion.
    *   A failure in the user account creation flow.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (This was a pivot from the initial FastAPI template).
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for data modeling.
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user sessions.
- **API:** RESTful API design for communication between frontend and backend.
- **Development Process:** Iterative frontend development with mock data, followed by full backend implementation and integration.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend communicating with a Node.js/Express backend via a REST API.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the entry point for the entire backend. It sets up the Express server, applies middleware (CORS, body-parser), connects to MongoDB, and mounts all the API routes from the  directory.
    -   **Changes**: Created from scratch to replace the initial Python/FastAPI server. It was edited multiple times to fix routing patterns () and remove problematic middleware () to get the server running correctly.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The root component of the React application. It sets up the  for routing and wraps the application with the  to provide authentication context to all child components.
    -   **Changes**: Initially a boilerplate file, it was heavily modified to include routes for all the new pages (, , , etc.) and to integrate the .

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: A critical piece for frontend state management. It provides user state (user object, token) and authentication functions (, , ) to the entire application, handling API calls and local storage persistence.
    -   **Changes**: Created to manage the frontend state after shifting from mock data to a real backend.

-   ** & **:
    -   **Importance**: These are the entry points for users into the application. Their functionality is critical for user acquisition.
    -   **Changes**: Initially built with mock logic, they were later refactored to use the  to make real API calls to the backend for user authentication.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file was created to define the API contract between the frontend and backend, outlining endpoints, request/response formats, and data models before backend implementation.
    -   **Changes**: Created as a planning document.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Fix the health endpoint routing issue identified by the backend testing agent.
- Resolve the three critical user-reported bugs:
  1.  The Failed to connect to MetaMask error appearing in forms.
  2.  The quiz progression error where it incorrectly states a question was not answered.
  3.  The complete failure of the account creation functionality.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a major phase of development: building a full Node.js backend from scratch and integrating it with the pre-existing, feature-rich React frontend. This involved replacing all mock data and frontend-only logic with real API calls for authentication, data fetching, and form submissions.

Immediately after this integration, the user performed manual testing and reported several critical, blocking bugs. The application, which worked perfectly with mock data, is now broken for key user flows.

The immediate task has pivoted from feature development to critical bug fixing. The engineer was about to address issues found by an automated backend test (), but the user's feedback has taken precedence. The current focus is to investigate the root cause of the MetaMask error, the quiz failure, and the registration block, as these issues make the application unusable. The MetaMask error is particularly strange, as the application has no intentional cryptocurrency or wallet integration, suggesting a potential dependency issue or injected script problem.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
I will begin by investigating the root cause of the Failed to connect to MetaMask error, as it is highly unusual and may be a symptom of a larger issue affecting all forms, including registration and the quiz.
